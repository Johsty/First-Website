    <h1> Johsty's Website </h1>
    <p> This website taught me how to use Github. However, I'm not sure if the way I am pushing commits is the best way. I'm using Github desktop and I've been commiting by saving the file into my local repository and pushing that way. It seems to be working for me, but I'm not sure if there is a more efficient method.</p>
